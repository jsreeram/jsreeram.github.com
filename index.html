          <h1>Motivation and Background</h1>

          <p>The goal of Intel Lab's River Trail project is to enable
          data-parallelism in web applications. In a world where the web
          browser is the user's window into computing, browser applications
          must leverage all available computing resources to provide the best
          possible user experience. Today web applications do not take full
          advantage of parallel client hardware due to the lack of appropriate
          programming models. River Trail puts the parallel compute power of
          client's hardware into the hands of the web developer while staying
          within the safe and secure boundaries of the familiar JavaScript
          programming paradigm. River Trail gently extends JavaScript with
          simple deterministic data-parallel constructs that are translated at
          runtime into a low-level hardware abstraction layer. By leveraging
          multiple CPU cores and vector instructions, River Trail programs can achieve significant speedup over sequential JavaScript.
          The River Trail API is being considered for
          standardization by the ECMA TC39 committee. You can read the API
          documentation and you can follow progress on standardization here.


          <p>
          An open-source prototype implementation of River Trail for
          Firefox is available <a
              href="https://github.com/RiverTrail/RiverTrail/"> here </a> and
          instructions for installing it are <a
              href="https://github.com/RiverTrail/RiverTrail/wiki">here</a>. This
          prototype implements a variant of the full River Trail API that
          compiles down to OpenCL and can be executed on CPUs and GPUs.
          See the <a
              href="https://github.com/RiverTrail/RiverTrail/wiki">wiki</a> for
          instructions on installing the River Trail prototype.

          <p>
          This tutorial is a gentle introduction to the River Trail language
          extensions and API.
          Note that this tutorial describes the River Trail API as
          implemented by this prototype and <em>not</em> the strawman API being
          considered for standardization.

          <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>
          <h2>
              Deterministic Parallel Execution
          </h2>
          <h2>The <em>ParallelArray</em> type</h2>
          <!--<h1>API</h1>-->
          <p>
          The central component of River Trail is the <em>ParallelArray</em>
          type. ParallelArray objects are essentially <em> ordered collecctions of
              scalar values </em>.

          <!--
          at a high-level like Java Script arrays -
          ordered collections of elements. Just like a Java Script array,
          the elements in a ParallelArray can be scalar values, or other objects
          such as other ParallelArrays, Java Script arrays or other Java Script objects.
          However ParallelArrays differ from Java
          Script arrays in a few important ways. ParallelArrays are:
          -->
          <h3>Multi-Dimensional and Uniform</h3>
          <p> ParallelArray objects can represent
          multi-dimensional collections of scalars.
          All ParallelArray objects have a <em>shape</em> that
          succintly describes the dimensionality and size of the object. The
          shape of a ParallelArray is defined as an array of numbers in which
          the value of the ith element is the number of elements in the ith dimension.
          So a 4x5 matrix of numbers can be represented as a ParallelArray
          object whose shape is [4, 5]. Similarly, a 2D image in which each
          pixel has RGBA values can be represented as a ParallelArray object
          with shape [height, width, 4] (and this is exactly what the
          constructor in line 41 below does).
          </p>
          <p>
          Multi-dimensional ParallelArrays are also required to be <em>uniform</em> (also called
          <em>rectangular</em>). That is, the length of all inner arrays in a
          particular dimension must be the same. For example, <br>
          <<0, 1>, <2>, <3, 4>> would be a non-uniform ParallelArray and is not
          allowed.
          </p>
          <h3>Immutable</h3>
          ParallelArrays are immutable once they are created. ParallelArrays
          are manipulated by invoking methods on them which produce new
          ParallelArray objects.
          </p>
          <h2> Constructors </h2>
          <p>
          <script
              src="http://gist.github.com/3299719.js"></script>
          </p>
          <h2>Elemental functions</h2>
          <h2> Methods </h2>
          ParallelArray objects created with the above constructors come with several methods to
          manipulate them. These methods typically produce a new ParallelArray
          object (except the <em>reduce</em> method which produces a scalar
          value).

          <h3> Map </h3>
          <p>
          The first method we will discuss is <em>map</em>, probably the most prominent and well known data-parallel skeleton.
          The <em>map</em> method expects a function as its first argument that given a single value produces a new value as its result.
          In the following, we will call such function <em>elemental function</em> as it is used to produce the elements of a ParallelArray object.
          The <em>map</em> method computes a new ParallelArray object out of an existing ParallelArray object by applying the provided
          elemental function to each element of the source array and storing the result in the corresponding position in the result array.
          Let us look at a simple example: increment
          </p>
          <pre class="brush: js;first-line: 1">
          var source = new ParallelArray([1,2,3,4,5]);
          var plusOne = source.map(function inc(v) { return v+1; });
          </pre>
          <p>
          First, we define a new ParallelArray object <code>source</code> that contains the numbers 1 to 5. We then call the <em>map</em> method
          of our source array with the function <code>inc</code> that computes the one increment of its argument. Thus, <code>plusOne</code> contains
          the values 2 to 6. Also note that <code>plusOne</code> has the same shape as the original array <code>source</code>. The <em>map</em> method is 
          shape preserving.
          </p><p>
          As you may have noticed, the <em>map</em> method does not provide an index to the elemental function it calls. We refer to this as <em>index free</em>
          computations. Not using an index has the advantage that no indexing errors can be made. However, this added simplicitly comes at the cost of expressiveness.
          With map, one can not inspect neighboring values, as commonly required for convolution style codes. 
          </p>
          <h3> Combine </h3>
          <p>
          The <em>combine</em> method addresses this issue. Similar to map, <em>combine</em> can be used to compute a new ParallelArray object by inspecting an
          existing ParallelArray object's element. Other than <em>map</em>, the elemental function of <em>combine</em> is provided with access to the current index
          in the source array, along with a reference to the source array itself.
          Let us revisit the increment example from the previous section. When using <em>combine</em>, increment can be expressed as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class="brush: js;first-line: 1">
          var source = new ParallelArray([1,2,3,4,5]);
          var plusOne = source.combine(function inc(i) { return this.get(i)+1; });
          </pre>
          <p>
          As before, we first produce our source array holding the values 1 to 5. We then apply the <em>combine</em> method using a slightly modified 
          version of the <code>inc</code> function. It now expects an index <code>i</code> as argument. Furthermore, the collection, i.e., the source 
          ParallelArray object is bound to the variable <code>this</code> within the elemental function's body. 
          We then compute the one increment of the value at index <code>i</code>. This element is computed by calling the <em>get</em> method 
          of the source ParallelArray object with index <code>i</code> as argument.
          </p><p>
          As this example shows, using <em>combine</em> requires more code to implement increment. However, we have gained expressiveness. As an example, 
          consider the following implementation of <em>reverse</em>:
          </p>
          <pre class="brush: js;first-line: 1">
          var source = new ParallelArray([1,2,3,4,5]);
          var reverse = source.combine(function rev(i) { return this.get(this.length-i[0]-1); });
          </pre>
          <p>
          In the elemental function <code>rev</code> we exploit the access to the index to compute the reversed index in the source array. Note that
          computations are driven by the index position in the result, not the index that is read. We therefore use the expression <code>this.length-i[0]-1</code> 
          to compute the source index of the reversed element for position <code>i</code> in the result array. This code makes use of the <em>length</em> 
          property of the ParallelArray object that, similar to JavaScript's Array object, gives the number of elements in the array.
          </p><p>
          It is important to note here that the index <code>i</code> is not a scalar value but actually a vector of indices. In the above example, we therefore 
          have to use <code>i[0]</code> in the computation of the source index. So far, all our examples computed on vectors and the use of an index vector
          in <em>combine></em> was of no help. However, ParallelArray objects in River Trail can have multiple dimensions. The <em>map</em> method always 
          operates on the outermost dimension only, i.e., on
          the dimension that corresponds to the first element of the shape vector. With <em>combine</em>, the programmer can choose how deep to traverse. For
          this, an optional first argument to the <em>combine</em> method is used. As an example, let us generalise the above reverse operation into a transpose
          on matrices:
          </p>
          <pre class="brush: js;first-line: 1">
          var source = new ParallelArray([4,4], function (iv) { return iv[0]*iv[1]; });
          var transpose = source.combine(2, function rev(iv) { return this.get([this.getShape()[0]-iv[0]-1, this.getShape()[1]-iv[1]-1]); });
          </pre>
          <p>
          We use a depth of 2 and, consequently, the index vector <code>iv</code> passed to the elemental function contains two indices, corresponding to the 
          two outer most dimensions of the source array. We also use the <em>getShape</em> method, which is the multi dimensional counterpart to <em>length</em>: 
          It returns a vector that gives the length for each dimension of a ParallelArray object. With <code>this.getShape()[0]-iv[0]-1</code> we thus compute 
          the index at the transposed position within the source array for the first dimension. Note here that <em>get</em> also accepts an index vector as argument.
          </p>
          <h3> Reduce </h3>
          <p>
          So far we have concentrated on parallel patterns that produce a new array out of an exisisting array. The <em>reduce</em> method implements a further 
          important parallel pattern: reduction operations. As the name suggest, a reduction operation reduces the elements from an array to a single result. A
          good example to start with is computing the sum of all elements of an array:
          </p>
          <pre class="brush: js;first-line: 1">
          var source = new ParallelArray([1,2,3,4,5]);
          var sum = source.reduce(function plus(a,b) { return a+b; });
          </pre>
          <p>
          As the example shows, the <em>reduce</em> method expects an elemental function as first argument that, given two values as parameters, produces a new
          value as its result. In our example, we use <code>plus</code> which adds two values. A reduction over plus then defines the sum operation.
          </p><p>
          Note here that the reduction may be computed in any order. In particular, this means that the elemental function has to be commutative and associative
          to ensure deterministic results. The River Trail runtime will not check this property but results might be different between calls even on the same
          platform.
          </p>
          <h3> Scan </h3>
          <p>
          The <em>reduce</em> methods reduces an array into a single value. For some uses cases, it can be interesting to also store the intermediate results. 
          One commonly used example is the prefix sum operation that, given a vector of numbers, computes another vector of numbers that at each position contains
          the sum of all elements of the source vector up to that position. To implement this parallel pattern, River Trail's ParallelArray features the 
          <em>scan</em> method.
          </p>
          <pre class="brush: js;first-line: 1">
          var source = new ParallelArray([1,2,3,4,5]);
          var psum = source.scan(function plus(a,b) { return a+b; });
          </pre>
          <p>
          As we are still computing a sum, the elemental function has not changed. We still use the <code>plus</code> operation from the previous reduction 
          example. However, when used with <em>scan</em> it now produces the prefix sum of the <code>source</code> array.
          <p><p>
          The same rules of parallel execution that apply to <em>reduce</em> also apply to <em>scan</em>. Although less obvious, <em>scan</em> can be computed in 
          parallel by reordering the reduction steps. Therefore, we only guarantee a determinstic result if the elemental function is commutative and associtive.
          </p>
