          <h1>Motivation and Background</h1>

          <p>The goal of Intel Lab's River Trail project is to enable
          data-parallelism in web applications. In a world where the web
          browser is the user's window into computing, browser applications
          must leverage all available computing resources to provide the best
          possible user experience. Today web applications do not take full
          advantage of parallel client hardware due to the lack of appropriate
          programming models. River Trail puts the parallel compute power of
          client's hardware into the hands of the web developer while staying
          within the safe and secure boundaries of the familiar JavaScript
          programming paradigm. River Trail gently extends JavaScript with
          simple deterministic data-parallel constructs that are translated at
          runtime into a low-level hardware abstraction layer. By leveraging
          multiple CPU cores and vector instructions, River Trail programs can achieve significant speedup over sequential JavaScript.
          The River Trail API is being considered for
          standardization by the ECMA TC39 committee. You can read the API
          documentation and you can follow progress on standardization here.


          <p>
          An open-source prototype implementation of River Trail for
          Firefox is available <a
              href="https://github.com/RiverTrail/RiverTrail/"> here </a> and
          instructions for installing it are <a
              href="https://github.com/RiverTrail/RiverTrail/wiki">here</a>. This
          prototype implements a variant of the full River Trail API that
          compiles down to OpenCL and can be executed on CPUs and GPUs.
          See the <a
              href="https://github.com/RiverTrail/RiverTrail/wiki">wiki</a> for
          instructions on installing the River Trail prototype. 
          </p>
          <p>
          This tutorial is a gentle introduction to the River Trail language
          extensions and API.
          Note that this tutorial describes the River Trail API as
          implemented by this prototype and <em>not</em> the strawman API being
          considered for standardization.

          <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>
          <h2>
              Deterministic Parallel Execution
          </h2>
          <h2>The <em>ParallelArray</em> type</h2>
          <!--<h1>API</h1>-->
          <p>
          The central component of River Trail is the <em>ParallelArray</em>
          type. ParallelArray objects are essentially <em> ordered collecctions of
              scalar values </em>.

          <!--
          at a high-level like Java Script arrays -
          ordered collections of elements. Just like a Java Script array,
          the elements in a ParallelArray can be scalar values, or other objects
          such as other ParallelArrays, Java Script arrays or other Java Script objects.
          However ParallelArrays differ from Java
          Script arrays in a few important ways. ParallelArrays are:
          -->
          <h3>Multi-Dimensional and Uniform</h3>
          <p> ParallelArray objects can represent
          multi-dimensional collections of scalars.
          All ParallelArray objects have a <em>shape</em> that
          succintly describes the dimensionality and size of the object. The
          shape of a ParallelArray is defined as an array of numbers in which
          the value of the ith element is the number of elements in the ith dimension.
          So a 4x5 matrix of numbers can be represented as a ParallelArray
          object whose shape is [4, 5]. Similarly, a 2D image in which each
          pixel has RGBA values can be represented as a ParallelArray object
          with shape [height, width, 4] (and this is exactly what the
          constructor in line 41 below does).
          </p>
          <p>
          Multi-dimensional ParallelArrays are also required to be <em>uniform</em> (also called
          <em>rectangular</em>). That is, the length of all inner arrays in a
          particular dimension must be the same. For example, <br>
          <<0, 1>, <2>, <3, 4>> would be a non-uniform ParallelArray and is not
          allowed.
          </p>
          <h3>Immutable</h3>
          ParallelArrays are immutable once they are created. ParallelArrays
          are manipulated by invoking methods on them which produce new
          ParallelArray objects.
          </p>
          <h2> Constructors </h2>
          <p>
          <script
              src="http://gist.github.com/3299719.js"></script>
          </p>
          <h2>Elemental functions</h2>
          <h2> Methods </h2>
          ParallelArray objects created with the above constructors come with several methods to
          manipulate them. These methods typically produce a new ParallelArray
          object (except the <em>reduce()</em> method which produces a scalar
          value).

          <h3> Map </h3>
          <h3> Reduce </h3>
          <h3> Scatter </h3>
          <h3> Filter </h3>
          <h3> Scan </h3>

          <h2> Examples </h2>
          <h3> Sum </h3>
          <h3> Minimum/Maximum </h3>
          <h3> Histogram </h3>

          <h2> Moving on </h2>
